# sudoku_solver
C++ implemention of solver which solve some easy sudoku problems. 

The code attempts to solve the sudoku problem in the same way you or I would - not the typical recursive or brute-force algorithms for this problem. It however lacks the ability to guess and as such cannot solve some difficult grids. Here I have included two grids that it does solve, for testing.

I completed this project as homework when taking the class CS24 at UCSB - the building blocks for this code was given to us by the instructor C.M Costanzo.
